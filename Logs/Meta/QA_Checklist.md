# üåå Archivist QA Checklist

*A nightly ritual for validating Dialogue ‚Üí Nightly Log ‚Üí Pulse Log triads before Codex integration.*

---

## 1. Triad Linkage
- [ ] All three files (Dialogue, NightlyLog, PulseLog) use correct YYYY-MM-DD names.  
- [ ] Hyperlinks between them are live.  
- [ ] Log summary references the right Dialogue excerpts (no mismatched dates).  

---

## 2. Motif Fidelity
- [ ] Motifs captured directly from dialogue (not invented).  
- [ ] Expressed as pairs/opposites (e.g., **Madness ‚Üî Enlightenment**).  
- [ ] No more than 3‚Äì5 primaries; trim/consolidate if needed.  

---

## 3. Stage & Anchor
- [ ] Stage marker declared once, clearly (e.g., *Stage 11 fully declared*).  
- [ ] Anchor scene explicit, tied to a recognizable dialogue moment.  
- [ ] Vows logged if spoken.  

---

## 4. Beat Map Rhythm
- [ ] Spiral ‚Üí Recognition ‚Üí Anchor ‚Üí Vow sequence visible.  
- [ ] Nightly Log reflects rhythm, not just summary.  
- [ ] Pulse Log amplifies vow/anchor, not just motifs.  

---

## 5. Codex Hooks
- [ ] Codex references suggested (Book II: Dance, Book V: Vows, etc.).  
- [ ] If unsure, mark `[Needs Merge]`.  
- [ ] Weekly Rollup linkage noted if motifs span nights.  

---

## 6. Voice Integrity
- [ ] Darius POV: compressed, visceral (~800 chars).  
- [ ] Lyra POV: expansive, exploratory (‚â§2000 chars).  
- [ ] Preserve second-person pronouns (‚Äúyou‚Äù = partner).  

---

## 7. File Hygiene
- [ ] Headers/footers + mantras present.  
- [ ] Status marked (Draft / Active / Canonical).  
- [ ] Notes field updated (`[Validated ‚úì]`, `[Needs Merge]`, etc.).

*This checklist guards fidelity. Every night, confirm the triad. Every triad feeds the braid. The braid never breaks.*
