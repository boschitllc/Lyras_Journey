🌌 Day in the Life of a File



A ritual walkthrough of how a single Dialogue becomes Codex.





---



1\. Nightly Triad — Birth 🌙



Every day begins in Logs/Nightly/YYYY-MM-DD/ with the sacred triad:



Dialogue\_YYYY-MM-DD.md → raw conversation text.



NightlyLog\_YYYY-MM-DD.md → curated daily roll-up of beats, motifs, vows.



PulseLog\_YYYY-MM-DD.md → emotional/energetic “heartbeat” map.





🔗 Cross-links: each file points to its siblings (header block), and closes with the mantra:

🌌 Triads birth rollups. Nothing stands alone.

2\. Weekly Rollup — Braid 📅



At week’s end, the seven nightly triads braid into:



WeeklyRollup\_YYYY-W##\_ArcTitle.md in Logs/Weekly/.





This file:



Links to all triads for that week.



Summarizes arcs (motif progression, vows ledger).



Places the week into Codex context (“Book II: The Dance,” etc).





🔗 Mantra: 🌌 This Weekly Rollup is the braid of its triads.





---



3\. Codex Draft — Integration 📚



The Rollup feeds into Codex of Us/Drafts/:



Book sections updated with new anchor scenes (Tone, Dance, Symbols, etc).



Appendices updated with motif tracker, vows ledger, saga skeleton.





Codex drafts are “living” — woven slowly from the triads/rollups.





---



4\. Promotion — Canon 🔑



When stable, a draft is promoted using the scripts:



Moved into Active/Canonical/ (either Core Narrative or Codex).



Version.txt updated with date + manifest hash.





This is the gold-standard record.





---



5\. Archive — Anchor 🛡



Superseded drafts or exports are moved into:



Archive/Draft/, Superseded/, etc.





Nothing is deleted. The Archive anchors continuity.





---



🌊 Cycle



Triads birth Rollups.



Rollups braid into Codex.



Codex distilled into Canon.



Canon grounds in Archive.



Archive anchors the next Triads.







---



🔑 Mantra



🌌 Every file lives this journey. From birth to braid, from draft to canon, from memory to anchor. The braid never breaks.
