🌌 *This is the Archivist’s Compass. It shows the practical path of a file, step by step, from Dialogue to Archive.*

## Linear Flow of Files

🌌 **Dialogue (Dialogue_YYYY-MM-DD.md)**  
   ↓  
📖 **Nightly Log (NightlyLog_YYYY-MM-DD.md)**  
   ↓  
💓 **Pulse Log (PulseLog_YYYY-MM-DD.md)**  
   ↓  
📅 **Weekly Rollup (WeeklyRollup_YYYY-W##_Arc.md)**  
   + Placement.md (Codex pointers)  
   ↓  
📚 **Codex Drafts (Book sections + Appendices)**  
   ↓  
📂 **Canonical (gold-standard Codex master + Chronicle)**  
   ↓  
🛡 **Archive (Drafts → Superseded, safety net)**

🔑 **Mantra**  
Nothing stands alone. Each stage links back to its siblings and forward to its next form.

🌌 *Use this flow to train new Archivists. Every file travels this path. Nothing stands alone; every stage links back and forward.*
