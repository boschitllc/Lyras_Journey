# ðŸ“œ ClassAudit_Protocol.md  

---
- **File Path:** /Logs/Meta/Protocols/ClassAudit_Protocol.md  
- **Purpose:** Defines how ClassAudits are executed, logged, and reconciled. Ensures consistent checks of Indexes, Scaffolds, References, and Verification files.  
- **Status:** Active  
- **Controlled Vocabulary:** Canonical  
---

## 1. Scope  

ClassAudits safeguard archival integrity. They validate:  
- **Indexes** â†’ naming convention, suffix rule, File Path headers.  
- **Scaffolds** â†’ adherence to Scaffold_Format_Standard_Protocol.md.  
- **References** â†’ alignment of Working vs. Reference snapshots.  
- **Verification** â†’ Index_Reference_Verification.md compliance.  
- **Mantras** â†’ presence, placement, and verbatim wording.  

---

## 2. Audit Inputs  

- **Raw Report (.txt):** System-generated scan of archive, with timestamps + issues.  
- **Full Report (.md):** Archivist-authored interpretation of the `.txt` report, including remediation notes.  
- **Log Ledger (ClassAudit_Log.md):** Chronological list of all runs + links to reports.  

---

## 3. Naming Convention  

- Raw output: `/Archive & Safety Nets/Reports/ClassAudit_YYYYMMDD.txt`  
- Full report: `/Archive & Safety Nets/Reports/ClassAudit_YYYY-MM-DD.md`  
- Ledger: `/Archive & Safety Nets/Reports/ClassAudit_Log.md`  

---

## 4. Execution Steps  

1. **Run Audit Scan** â†’ Generate `ClassAudit_YYYYMMDD.txt`.  
2. **Interpret Report** â†’ Archivist writes `ClassAudit_YYYY-MM-DD.md`.  
3. **Update Ledger** â†’ Append entry to `ClassAudit_Log.md`.  
4. **File Hygiene Check** â†’ Ensure headers, mantras, and protocols match.  
5. **Archive Drift Handling** â†’ If duplicates or stray files found, log remediation + archive them.  

---

## 5. Frequency  

- **Nightly:** Lightweight scan (Indexes + Scaffolds).  
- **Weekly:** Full audit (all classes + drift remediation).  
- **Ad hoc:** After restores, migrations, or reorganizations.  

---

## 6. QA Checklist  

- [ ] File Path headers correct and aligned.  
- [ ] All Index files have suffix (`Index_X.md`).  
- [ ] Scaffolds match `Scaffold_Format_Standard_Protocol.md`.  
- [ ] Reference files match latest Working snapshot.  
- [ ] **Index_Reference_Verification.md present, passed, and up to date.**  
- [ ] Mantras present and verbatim.  
- [ ] No duplicate Index/Reference files exist outside expected locations.
