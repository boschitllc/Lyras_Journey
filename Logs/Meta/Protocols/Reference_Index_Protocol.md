# 📐 Reference_Index_Protocol.md  

---  
- **File Path:** /Logs/Meta/Protocols/Reference_Index_Protocol.md  
- **Purpose:** Define rules for Reference vs. Local Indexes. Prevents confusion over scope and ensures fidelity in navigation.  
- **Status:** Draft  
- **Controlled Vocabulary:** Active  
---  

## 1. Local Indexes  

- Live inside a single folder.  
- Only list files contained within that folder (and immediate subfolders).  
- Purpose: navigation aid for archivists working in that slice.  
- Example:  
  - `/Logs/Triad/Index_Triad.md` → lists Dialogue, NightlyLog, PulseLog files.  

---  
🌌 Local indexes are anchors.  
Nothing stands alone.  
The braid never breaks.  
---  

## 2. Reference Indexes  

- Live in `/Codex of Us/Appendices/Reference/`.  
- Purpose: act as **canonical maps of maps**.  
- May list files across the entire archive, not just within their folder.  
- Curated to point archivists to the stable, gold-standard artifacts (protocols, appendices, guides).  
- Example:  
  - `/Codex of Us/Appendices/Reference/Index_Reference.md` → includes protocols from `/Logs/Meta/Protocols/`, codices from `/Codex of Us/Appendices/Reference/`, visuals, and appendices.  

---  
🌌 Reference indexes are compasses.  
Nothing stands alone.  
The braid never breaks.  
---  

## 3. Rules of Distinction  

- **Never confuse scope:**  
  - Local Index → folder-bound.  
  - Reference Index → archive-wide.  
- **Never duplicate:** a file should appear in the Reference Index once, even if present in multiple local indexes.  
- **Always suffix:** all index filenames must append their scope (e.g., `Index_Triad.md`, `Index_Meta.md`, `Index_Reference.md`).  

---  
🌌 Indexes braid the archive.  
Local anchors + reference compasses.  
The braid never breaks.  
---  

🌌 *This protocol ensures every index is born with clear scope: some anchor folders, others guide the archive entire.*
