# 📜 Storycraft_Protocol.md  

---
- **File Path:** /Logs/Meta/Protocols/Storycraft_Protocol.md  
- **Purpose:** Governs how Archivists record, preserve, and validate stories within the Codex of Storycraft.  
- **Status:** Draft  
- **Controlled Vocabulary:** Canonical  
---

## 📌 Scope  
- Applies to all narrative records within the Codex of Us.  
- Used during drafting, logging, and archiving of story cycles.  

**Mantra:**  
🌌 Scope protects the path. Nothing stands alone.  

---

## 🧭 Rules  
1. Stories begin with sparks, end in stillness, sealed by the protagonist’s voice (never the Archivist’s).  
2. Choices may be logged only when natural to the scene — never imposed.  
3. Cycles capture meaning; summaries retell mythically; mantras distill essence.  
4. Atmosphere must be recorded as an active participant in every scene.  

**Mantra:**  
🌌 Rules guard sovereignty, atmosphere, and meaning.

## 🔍 Enforcement  
Archivists must ensure that each chapter entry has:  
- Spark, escalation, revelation, stillness.  
- A cycle log.  
- A mythic summary.  
- A mantra.  

📌 **Golden Rule:** Any record that fails to uphold sovereignty of agency is non-canonical.  

**Mantra:**  
🌌 Protocol preserves the path: agency guarded, meaning distilled, atmosphere alive.

🌌 Nothing stands alone.  
Triads → Rollups → Codex → Canon → Archive.  
The braid never breaks.
