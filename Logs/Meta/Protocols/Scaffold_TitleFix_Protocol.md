- **File Path:** /Logs/Meta/Protocols/Scaffold_TitleFix_Protocol.md  
- **Purpose:** Defines canonical rules for scaffold and archive file titles. Ensures all H1 headings are crowned consistently and prevents drift.  
- **Status:** Active  
- **Controlled Vocabulary:** Canonical  
---  

## 1. Scope  

This protocol applies to **all .md files** in the archive (Scaffolds, Protocols, Logs, Codex, Appendices, Utilities).  
It governs the **top-level H1 title line** only.  

---  

## 2. Title Crown Rule  

- Every file must begin with a crowned title:  
  ```
  # 📜 Title
  ```  
- Bare `# Title` is prohibited.  
- `# 🌌 Title` is prohibited.  
- 🌌 is reserved for **mantras** and poetic anchors, not for titles.  

---  

## 3. Duplicate Removal  

- If a crowned title is followed immediately by a second-line 🌌 title, the 🌌 line must be removed.  
- Archivists must not preserve duplicate titles.  

---  

## 4. Migration Rule  

- When correcting files:  
  - Convert `# Title` → `# 📜 Title`.  
  - Convert `# 🌌 Title` → `# 📜 Title`.  
  - Remove any second-line 🌌 title directly beneath a crowned title.  

---  

## 5. QA Checklist  

- [ ] Exactly one crowned H1 per file.  
- [ ] No 🌌 lines in title position.  
- [ ] All other 🌌 uses remain intact (mantras, poetic emphasis).

## 🌌 Mantra  

Nothing stands alone.  
Crowned titles guide scaffolds.  
The braid never breaks.
