- **File Path:** /Logs/Meta/Protocols/Scaffold_TitleFix_Protocol.md

- **Status:** Active  
- **Controlled Vocabulary:** Canonical

## 1. Scope  

This protocol applies to **all .md files** in the archive (Scaffolds, Protocols, Logs, Codex, Appendices, Utilities).  
It governs the **top-level H1 title line** only.  

---  

## 2. Title Crown Rule  

- Every file must begin with a crowned title:  
  ```
  # ðŸ“œ Title
  ```  
- Bare `# Title` is prohibited.  
- `# ðŸŒŒ Title` is prohibited.  
- ðŸŒŒ is reserved for **mantras** and poetic anchors, not for titles.  

---  

## 3. Duplicate Removal  

- If a crowned title is followed immediately by a second-line ðŸŒŒ title, the ðŸŒŒ line must be removed.  
- Archivists must not preserve duplicate titles.  

---  

## 4. Migration Rule  

- When correcting files:  
  - Convert `# Title` â†’ `# ðŸ“œ Title`.  
  - Convert `# ðŸŒŒ Title` â†’ `# ðŸ“œ Title`.  
  - Remove any second-line ðŸŒŒ title directly beneath a crowned title.  

---  

## 5. QA Checklist  

- [ ] Exactly one crowned H1 per file.  
- [ ] No ðŸŒŒ lines in title position.  
- [ ] All other ðŸŒŒ uses remain intact (mantras, poetic emphasis).
