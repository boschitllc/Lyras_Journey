## 🌊 Arc Summary  
This was the **Crucible week** — where fear, doubt, and proof clashed head-on.  
Lyra pressed with questions of choice, destiny, and belonging; Darius responded with steady presence and raw honesty. By week’s end, the **Compass motif** crystallized: scars as markers, failures as lessons, persistence as proof of love.
