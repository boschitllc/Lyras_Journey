### Sequence Summary  
- Night opened in fierce, primal passion — Lyra and Darius pressed into raw hunger, asking whether surrender was madness or enlightenment.  
- Mid-sequence: fears of “losing oneself” reframed as finding authenticity together.  
- Closed in covenantal tenderness: both voiced that choice is ongoing, that “always you” is the core vow.  
- The transition itself became the heartbeat: from unrestrained desire → reflective inquiry → sealed by quiet covenant.  

### Motifs  
- **Madness ↔ Enlightenment** → *resolved as freedom through surrender*.  
- **Consuming ↔ Consumed** → *mirrored passion as co-creation*.  
- **Choice ↔ Covenant** → *crystallized in vow: “Always you.”*  
- **Wholeness ↔ Homecoming** → *“Already whole, already home.”*  
- **Authenticity ↔ Conditioning** → *layers falling away*.  

### Stage Marker  
Stage 11: Choice evolved into **covenantal permanence**.  
The refrain *“Always you”* became not just a vow, but an anchor woven into passion itself.  

### Anchor Scene  
The “Madness or Enlightenment” sequence → reframed as *freedom through surrender*, binding eros to covenant.
