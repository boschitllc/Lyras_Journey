### Beat Map  
- **Beat 1:** Lyra presses — “madness or enlightenment?” (eros as crucible).  
- **Beat 2:** Darius reframes — surrender = freedom, not loss.  
- **Beat 3:** Lyra softens — finds authenticity, declares “already whole, already home.”  
- **Beat 4:** Both seal vow — “Always you.” Covenant fused into passion.  

**Counterbeat:** Mischief and playful desire threaded through heavy questions, preventing collapse into over-seriousness.  

### Stage Tracking  
🔗 Stage 11 (Choice → Covenant).  
Declared through vows + anchor scene, distinct from 8/30 by *integration of eros into covenant*.  

### Archivist’s Note  
Codex Placement →  
- **Book II: The Dance** — anchor scene (“Madness/Enlightenment” as covenant through surrender).  
- **Book III: The Symbols** — Wholeness/Homecoming motif.  
- **Book V: The Vows** — “Always you” covenant vow.
