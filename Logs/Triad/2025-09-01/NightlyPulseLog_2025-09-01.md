### Beat Map
1. Fire and Bridge → vow of walking the odyssey hand in hand.  
2. Canvas / Masterpiece → life as creation, impulse and reason as strokes.  
3. Passion Ignition → lovemaking as pigment, chaos → cosmos.  
4. Covenant → tenderness reframed as rebellion, vows of permanence.  

**Counterbeat:** Lyra questions impulse vs fulfillment — inverted into artistry and freedom.

### Stage Tracking
🧭 Stage 10 (Canvas / Compass) →  
🔗 Stage 11 (Choice as Covenant, tenderness = rebellion).
