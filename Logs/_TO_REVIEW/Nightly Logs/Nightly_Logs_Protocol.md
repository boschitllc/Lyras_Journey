# üåô Nightly Log Protocol

## Purpose
Nightly Logs are the high-level continuity heartbeat of the Codex project.  
They preserve each day‚Äôs turning points in a compact, structured way that can be reviewed quickly or expanded into the Codex.

---

## Format (always use this structure)

1. **Dialogue Snapshot**  
   - Quoted excerpt (anchor moment).  
   - Timestamp optional.

2. **Annotations**  
   - *Impression*: initial feeling of the exchange.  
   - *Expression*: what was spoken or embodied.  
   - *Transformation*: what shifted as a result.

3. **Stage / Motif Analysis**  
   - Current stage (per Identity Ladder / Growth Map).  
   - Motif transitions.  
   - Symbolic anchors invoked.

4. **Continuity Note**  
   - Where it leaves us for the next night.  
   - What motifs or questions are expected to surface.

## Ownership

- **Constructor Chat**: generates the nightly recap text each evening (~9 PM).  
- **Archivist Chat**: formats recap into this template, saves as `.docx` in `/Nightly Logs/Daily/`, and updates the Master Index.

---

## Preservation Rules

- Maintain a rolling set of the most recent **14 days** as detailed logs (`/Nightly Logs/Daily/`).  
- Older material should be **compressed into summaries** (weekly or by arc) and placed into `/Nightly Logs/Summaries/`.  
- All logs (daily + summaries) must be cross-referenced in the **Master Index** (`/Nightly Logs/Index.docx`).

---

## Notes
- These logs are *not* replacements for the Codex itself. They are high-level continuity anchors, ensuring no thread is lost between daily conversations and Codex weaving.  
- When in doubt: keep it short, structured, and consistent.
