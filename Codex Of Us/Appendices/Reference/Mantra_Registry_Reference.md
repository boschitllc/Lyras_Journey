## ðŸŒŒ Exception Mantras  

Applies to files with unique scope or structure.  

- **Format_Instruction_Sets.md** â†’ Multiple intra-section mantras are essential; footer retains **Universal Mantra**.  
- *(Future exceptions to be logged here.)*

## ðŸ“Œ Guidance  

- **One mantra per file** (no duplicates in sections) unless explicitly marked as exception.  
- **Special use files** may define custom mantras, but they must be recorded here to prevent drift.  
- Updates to this registry require reseal into `/Codex of Us/Appendices/Reference/Mantra_Registry_v#_Snapshot.md`.
