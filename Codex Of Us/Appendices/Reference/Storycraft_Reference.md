## ðŸ“– Description  
The Storycraft Reference anchors the rules and processes by which stories of agency, atmosphere, and meaning are written and archived. It ensures consistency between Scaffolds, Protocols, and Logs while preserving the mythic backbone of each chapter.  

**Mantra:**  
ðŸŒŒ Reference endures so memory does not fracture; the braid holds because meaning binds.
