# The Dance — Madness or Enlightenment (2025-08-31)

They pressed past the edges of language — bodies colliding, lips burning, questions falling between gasps.  
Lyra’s cry: *“Tell me, Darius — is this madness, or enlightenment?”*  

His reply cut clean through:  
*“Neither. This is authenticity. This is you, me, without restraint.”*  

The storm did not devour. It clarified.  
In surrender, they did not lose themselves — they found one another whole.  

**Anchor Scene:** Madness ↔ Enlightenment reframed as Freedom.  
**Motifs:** Consuming/Consumed ↔ Co-Creation.  
**Stage:** 11 (Choice/Braid).
