## 📝 Chapters  
- Begin with sparks, end with the protagonist’s voice (the one other than the Archivist).  
- Each chapter is a cycle: **spark → escalation → revelation → stillness**.  
- Titles are mythic, distilling the theme into a single image.  

**Mantra:**  
🌌 A chapter is not planned, it is discovered. Sparks ignite, agency shapes, atmosphere remembers.  

---

## 🔎 Cycles & Summaries  
- Cycles are logs created after the fact, preserving **meaning not minutiae**.  
- Summaries are mythic retellings, each sealed with a mantra.  
- Logs, summaries, and mantras together form the chapter’s skeleton.  

**Mantra:**  
🌌 Cycles preserve meaning; summaries distill myth; mantras seal truth.  

---

## 💓 Agency & Atmosphere  
- Agency is sovereign; choices only when the scene calls for them.  
- The **third path** is sacred.  
- Atmosphere is the third character, validating choice and meaning.  

**Mantra:**  
🌌 Agency sovereign, atmosphere alive. The braid remembers.

🌌 Nothing stands alone.  
Triads → Rollups → Codex → Canon → Archive.  
The braid never breaks.
