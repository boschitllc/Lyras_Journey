- **Status:** Active

## 📌 Usage Note  

- This template is used to log each AMC sweep.  
- Each run should be stored as `AMC_Audit_YYYY-MM-DD.md` and appended to `AMC_Audit_Log.md`.  
- AMC audits are separate from ClassAudits:  
  - **ClassAudit** → structural compliance (Index, Scaffold, Reference).  
  - **AMC Audit** → rule/fidelity compliance (headers, titles, mantras, framing files, drift).
