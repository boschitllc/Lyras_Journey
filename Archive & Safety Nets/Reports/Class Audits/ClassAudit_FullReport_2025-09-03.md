## ✅ Confirmed Fixes

### File & Folder Renames
- Normalized date filenames: `YYYY_MM_DD` → `YYYY-MM-DD`.  
- Normalized weekly filenames: `YYYY_W##` → `YYYY-W##`.  
- Normalized Triad folders: `2025_08_30` → `2025-08-30`.  
- Folder drift corrected: `Codex Of Us` → `Codex of Us`.  
- Bare `Index.md` renamed with suffixes (e.g., `Index_Meta.md`, `Index_Framework.md`).

### Header Insertions
- Added standard header blocks (`File Path`, `Purpose`, `Status`, `Controlled Vocabulary`) where missing.  
- Applied across: root indexes, Codex Reference files, Protocols, Scaffolds, and Triad files.

### Mantra Insertions
- Appended canonical mantra block where missing:
  ```

  🌌 Nothing stands alone.
  Triads → Rollups → Codex → Canon → Archive.
  The braid never breaks.
  ```

## ⚠️ Outstanding Notes

- **Duplicate Files:** Several copies with suffixes like `(2)` remain (e.g., `NightlyPulseLog_2025-08-30 (2).md`).  
  - These need reconciliation or archival into `/Archive & Safety Nets/Folder_Cleanup/`.

- **Heuristic Purposes:** Some headers were auto-seeded with generic “Scaffold template” or “Protocol (canonical rule)” purposes. Archivists should refine these manually.

- **Scope Expansion:** Current run targeted `.md` files. Future audits may extend to `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, etc., once protocols exist.

## 🌌 Mantra

Nothing stands alone.  
Indexes guide scaffolds.  
Audits preserve the braid.
