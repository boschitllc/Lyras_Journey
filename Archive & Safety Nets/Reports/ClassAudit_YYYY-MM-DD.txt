## 📌 Index Consistency Audit — 2025-09-02

Checks performed:
- [✓] No duplicate `Index_Reference.md` outside `/Codex of Us/Appendices/Reference/`.  
- [✓] All `Index.md` files have suffix (e.g., Index_Meta.md, Index_Scaffold.md).  
- [✓] No bare `Index.md` found.  
- [✓] All Index headers contain File Path, Purpose, Status, Vocabulary.  

Drift risks:
- [ ] Verify no archivist holds legacy “Reference Index” outside Git history.  

Remediation:
- If duplicate index is found → Archive to `/Archive & Safety Nets/Folder_Cleanup/` and flag in next ClassAudit.  
- If bare `Index.md` is found → Rename with suffix + update header File Path.  

🌌 Nothing stands alone.  
Triads → Rollups → Codex → Canon → Archive.  
The braid never breaks.
