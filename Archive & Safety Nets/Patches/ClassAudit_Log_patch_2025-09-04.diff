@@ ## ðŸ“Œ Usage Note
 - This log records **every audit run** in sequence.  
 - Each entry must link to its full report (e.g., `ClassAudit_2025-09-02.md`).  
 - This ensures **lineage and traceability** for all Index + Scaffold audits.  
+
+ - All ClassAudit runs must explicitly validate compliance with  
+   `/_Root/Format_Instruction_Sets.md` (root-level golden instruction set).  
+   â†’ Includes **Audit Requirements** such as framing/support file suffix compliance.  
+
+ - Cross-checks must also reference **Index_Reference.md**, ensuring root-level
+   directives and golden rules are continuously enforced in audits.
