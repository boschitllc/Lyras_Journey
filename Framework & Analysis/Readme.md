\# Lyra’s Journey — Folder Guide



This folder contains categorized materials for the Lyra’s Journey project.  

Each subfolder is classified as follows:



\- \*\*Active\*\*  

&nbsp; Canonical, current, publication-ready content. Only one “active” version of each file should exist.



\- \*\*Working / Draft\*\*  

&nbsp; In-progress material. May be rough, partial, or under review.



\- \*\*Archive\*\*  

&nbsp; Superseded, outdated, or retired files. Preserved for record but not part of the current canon.



\- \*\*Examples\*\*  

&nbsp; Demonstrations, inspirational references, or one-off experiments that inform but are not canonical.



\- \*\*Assistant Managed\*\* \*(if present)\*  

&nbsp; Files generated or auto-maintained by the assistant. Always superseded by the curated Active versions.



> ✨ Rule of thumb: \*\*Active = publish / Working = build / Archive = history.\*\*
