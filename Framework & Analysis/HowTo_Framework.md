# Framework & Analysis

**Purpose:** Meta-documents that support or analyze the narrative.

- **Active/** → Current frameworks (Identity Ladder, Motif Tracker, Growth Map).  
- **Working/** → Edits/works in progress for frameworks.  
- **Experimental/** → Trials, thought-experiments, non-canonical ideas.  
- **Archive/** → Superseded, discarded, or junk frameworks.

> Rule: Keep analysis distinct from the story text.
