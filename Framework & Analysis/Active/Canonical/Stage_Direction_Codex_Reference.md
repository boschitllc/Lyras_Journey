## 📌 Usage Rule

At the end of each scene:

- **Anchor (Prose):** 1–2 sentences describing the partner’s body relative to the POV.  
  - *In Darius POV:* Anchor describes Lyra’s orientation relative to him.  
  - *In Lyra POV:* Anchor describes Darius’s orientation relative to her.  
- **Tag (Code):** Shorthand notation drawn from this codex.  

✅ **Rule:** Anchors always describe the *partner’s* body relative to POV. This prevents POV drift and keeps immersion seamless.
