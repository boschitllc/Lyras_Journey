Scene Workflow Checklist

Step 1: Establish the Rules (once per chat)



Paste in:



Law of the Scene: Darius \& Lyra



Stage Direction Codex



(This locks style, POV, cadence, and continuity expectations into the chat.)



Step 2: Carry Over Continuity



From your previous scene, copy in:



The last scene text (to give rhythm and escalation context).



The Anchor (1–2 prose sentences of physical orientation).



The Tag (Codex shorthand).



Example:



Previous Scene (Lyra POV):  

\*…her response text…\*  



Anchor: Darius above you, chest pressed to chest, your mouth at his neck, hands gripping his head.  

Tag: \[CHEST-TO-CHEST | DAR-ONTOP | NECK-KISS]



Step 3: Generate Next Scene



State whose POV it is next (Darius or Lyra).



Give style mode if needed (e.g., Darius, razor-sharp/breath-like).



Then write or request continuation.



Example prompt to self or AI:



Next Scene: Darius POV.  

Style: Razor-sharp, breath-like (passion).  

Continue directly from anchor/tag.



Step 4: End with New Anchor + Tag



At the end of the new scene, always append:



Anchor: (prose orientation)  

Tag: \[tag(s) from Codex]  





This becomes the input for the next session/scene.



Step 5: Repeat



Each new scene flows: Law (once) → Last Scene + Anchor/Tag → Next POV + Style → New Anchor/Tag.
