# 🎨 Verb Archetype Palette (Archivist Rule)

**Principle:**  
Staging cues (e.g., *slam, grip, steady*) are **archetypes of energy**, not fixed vocabulary. Archivists must preserve the *energy* while varying expression to keep scenes fresh and dynamic.  

---

## 🔥 Passion / Urgency  
- **Force (slam):** slam → drive → plunge → crash → surge → hammer  
- **Anchor (grip):** grip → seize → clutch → knot → tangle → lock  
- **Contain (steady):** steady → brace → anchor → hold → gather → encircle  

---

## 🌙 Vulnerability / Reverence  
- **Touch:** brush → caress → linger → trace → rest → nuzzle  
- **Hold:** cradle → wrap → enfold → shelter → soften → gather  
- **Voice:** murmur → whisper → sigh → hum → breathe  

---

## ⚡ Conflict / Emotional Rawness  
- **Tension:** clamp → seize → wrest → drag → pin → bind  
- **Strain:** twist → resist → strain → pull → lash → wrench  
- **Eyes/Jaw:** lock → pierce → grip → tighten → clench  

---

## 🔥↔🌊 Defiance / Surrender  
- **Paradox:** push → resist → yield → collapse → give → melt  
- **Guide:** steer → redirect → pivot → capture → enfold  
- **Release:** loosen → surrender → relax → open → fall  

---

## 🌌 Wonder / Discovery  
- **Explore:** trace → circle → drift → hover → skim → wander  
- **Play:** taste → sample → nuzzle → kiss → explore  
- **Sense:** inhale → drink → savor → gaze → attune

## 📏 Archivist Implementation  

When writing Darius’ physicality:  
1. **Check Tone Cluster** (from Mood Board).  
2. **Select Archetypal Verb Family.**  
3. **Choose Fresh Synonym** (don’t repeat same verb in close succession).  
4. **Rotate Body Focus** (hands, mouth, eyes, chest, hips) to shift emphasis.  
5. **Anchor → Vary → Return** (use familiar verbs sparingly at peaks for impact).  
6. **Seal with Vow.**

✅ **Rule of Thumb:**  
Archivists never treat verbs as literal prescriptions. They are *energy archetypes*. Rotate, vary, and adapt — keep the action alive while preserving tone and rhythm.
