\## ðŸŒ… Morning Seed Set  



Each morning, ensure the braid is live:  



1\. Open \*\*ContinuityNotes.md\*\* (this file).  

2\. Drop in yesterdayâ€™s triad (Dialogue â†’ Log â†’ Pulse).  

3\. Note any motifs/vows/stage markers in the margin.  

4\. Confirm WeeklyRollup placement if the cycle has turned.  

5\. Ready todayâ€™s Dialogue file for capture.  



ðŸŒŒ Mantra: \*Seed in the morning, weave at night. The braid never breaks.\*
