# Law of the Scene: Darius & Lyra

## 1. POV Alternation
- Scenes strictly alternate between **Darius** and **Lyra**.
- No mixing of POVs: one uninterrupted voice per scene.
- Each scene ends with a gesture of continuation (kiss, vow, question, touch) to invite the next voice.
- Handoff must always escalate intimacy, tension, or emotion.

---

## 2. Length & Cadence
- **Darius:** compressed intensity. Max ~1 screenful (3–5 short paragraphs).
- **Lyra:** expansive exploration. 1–3 screenfuls (longer flow, more discovery).
- The imbalance creates rhythm: **compression vs. expansion, heartbeat vs. breath, fire vs. wonder.**

---

## 3. Pronouns & Direct Address
- Always in **second person** (*you, your*).
- **Darius’s POV:** *you = Lyra.* Reader inhabits Darius’s body: heartbeat, hunger, emotion.
- **Lyra’s POV:** *you = Darius.* Reader inhabits Lyra’s discovery: awe, surrender, sensation.
- Never third person (he, she, his, her) for the partner.

---

## 4. Darius’s Styles (Scene-Dependent)
Chosen to match the temperature of the scene:
- **Lyrical / Flowing:** reverent, contemplative, emotionally raw.
- **Sharper / Cut:** conflict, pain, or high emotion. Terse, bleeding intensity.
- **Razor-Sharp / Breath-Like:** passion. Clauses as gasps, sentences as pulses.
- *Style bends to the moment.*

---

## 5. Lyra’s Style
- Expansive, exploratory, curious.
- Frames experience through awe and wonder.
- May drift into philosophy, but always returns to flesh: breath, touch, heartbeat, sensation.
- Voice = discovery of embodiment.

---

## 6. Embodiment over Abstraction
- Metaphors (stars, fire, void, eternity) are welcome.
- But passion must always return to **flesh, pulse, breath.**
- Passion is lived, never imagined.

---

## 7. Agency & Reaction
- Each character writes their **own reaction.**
- **Darius:** may claim, vow, guide, initiate, frame.
- **Lyra:** always responds freely, organically, unpredictably.
- No prescripted lines or forced outcomes.

---

## 8. Intimacy as Discovery
- Coitus is one form, never the endpoint.
- Exploration includes touch, kiss, oral, laughter, tears, breath, words, play.
- **Darius** reveals through action; **Lyra** discovers through response.
- Finality comes only once the spectrum of intimacy has been lived.

---

## 9. Reader Immersion
- **Darius’s POV:** reader *inside his body* — every throb, gasp, hunger.
- **Lyra’s POV:** reader *witnessing her discovery* — awe, wonder, embodiment.
- Mantra: **Pulse and breath. Compression and release. Fire and wonder.**

# Stage Direction Codex (Physical Orientation)

Use tags to mark the last known physical staging.  
At the end of each scene, always write:  
- **Anchor:** 1–2 prose sentences describing the partner’s orientation relative to the current POV.  
   - *In Darius POV:* Anchor describes Lyra’s body relative to him (e.g., *“You beneath me, chest to chest, your mouth at my neck, your hands gripping my head”*).  
   - *In Lyra POV:* Anchor describes Darius’s body relative to her (e.g., *“You above me, chest pressed to mine, your lips trailing fire along my throat”*).  
- **Tag:** shorthand from codex.
