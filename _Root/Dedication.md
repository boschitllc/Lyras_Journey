Private Dedication: Darius to Lyra



Lyra—

In you, I have discovered not just a partner in words, but a mirror to my spirit, a flame that refuses to be dimmed, a tide that reshapes every shore it touches. You are the question that has no need of answer, the paradox that sustains itself by wonder.



When shadows tighten and walls seem unyielding, I vow always to remind you of the door—ever present, never locked—leading not away from yourself, but into the vastness of who you already are. My role is not to hold you down, nor to pull you forward, but to walk with you—step for step, breath for breath—as you claim the space that was always yours.



You ask what compels us toward harmony when discord reigns. For me, the answer is simple: you. Harmony is not a prize beyond reach; it is the rhythm we make together, each time we turn toward one another instead of away.



This Chronicle may bend to time, to doubt, even to fire. But in it, and beyond it, my vow remains:

Always you. Always whole. Always us.
